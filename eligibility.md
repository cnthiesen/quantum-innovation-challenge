# Team and project submission requirements

One member of your three main representatives of your project team has to be affiliated with an academic institution. A hosting letter is required signed from the head of department, from the administrative institution that will receive the voucher to access the Gefion supercomputer.
You can send this letter to quantum_challenge@mqs.dk and we will mark your team as validated in the specific github issue with a badge where you have announced your team and project name.

The project submission has to be submitted via a github pull request where your code repository is licensed under the MIT (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)) or Apache Version 2.0 license (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). If your submitted repository has no license affiliated with it, then your submission will be regarded as invalid and not taken into evaluation.

# Vouchers for the Gefion AI Supercomputer

The five best teams will receive vouchers for the Gefion supercompute access through their academic team member(s).

## 1.1 Purpose

The primary scope of the “Grants for access to the Gefion AI Supercomputer” programme is to accelerate research projects by utilising the computational power of Gefion. Through this programme, the Novo Nordisk Foundation (the Foundation) awards vouchers to academic users, enabling them to utilise the Gefion AI Supercomputer for a specified number of GPU hours. Applicants should ensure their projects are in a mature state, ready to utilise the
supercomputer’s resources effectively within 2025. The Danish Centre for AI Innovation (DCAI) runs and operates Gefion, a large-scale NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD. It comprises 191 NVIDIA DGX H100 systems for a total of 1,528 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs (more information at https://dcai.dk/).

## 1.2 Areas of support
The programme supports research projects involving computationally demanding tasks, such as simulations, data analysis, and training of AI models. These projects can encompass various applications, including but not limited to, large language models, simulations of physical or chemical systems, and other complex computational challenges. The supported fields include medical sciences, life sciences, sustainability, or natural and technical sciences, in alignment with the Novo Nordisk Foundation’s 2030 Strategy.

## 1.3 Eligibility
To be eligible for a grant, the following requirements must be met:
- The applicant must be employed at or affiliated with a university, hospital, or other
non-profit research institution in Denmark. This institution will serve as administering
institution for the grant.
- The applicant must have obtained a PhD degree; researchers at any career stage after
obtaining their PhD are eligible to apply.
- Applicants must clearly demonstrate their ability to work with advanced supercomputing in their CV. No specific scientific background is required, but applicants typically have training in computer science, mathematics, physics, computational chemistry, or computational biology. If the applicants’ background does not directly indicate supercomputing expertise, they must explain how they will ensure that the necessary skills are available for the project.

## 1.4 Funding (vouchers)
Grants will be awarded as vouchers for GPU hours on Gefion. From the date a voucher has
been issued, it must be used within 6 months.

The Quantum Innovation Challenge (respectively BII Deep Tech Lab) will only award vouchers for GPU hours. BII Deep Tech Lab will not award funding for:
- Commercial activities
- Overhead/indirect costs (such as rent, electricity, water and maintenance)
- Double funding of projects:
- If the applicant has received funding for the proposed project from other sources, in part or in full, this must be accounted for in the budget, as no budgetary overlaps are allowed
- If an identical or overlapping project proposal has been submitted to other funding institutions than the Foundation, it must be noted in the application
- If the applicant receives funding for the project, or parts of the project, from other sources following submission of the application to the Quantum Innovation Challenge, the organizers of the Quantum Innovation Challenge must be informed immediately (quantum_challenge@mqs.dk).

## 1.5 Language
The Quantum Innovation Challenge project and all additional materials must be submitted in English.

## 1.6 Application process
When all applications have been assessed, applicants will be notified about whether they
have been awarded a grant. The notification e-mail will be sent from norma-noreply@novo.dk
to the e-mail address used when creating a profile in NORMA.
PLEASE NOTE: The scientific committee of Quantum Innovation Challenge does not provide feedback in case a project submission is declined as one of the top five projects. But there will be efforts to share a feedback and rating document to all participating teams for maintaining transparency and valuable feedback for future developments of the submitted project.

## 2. Assessment criteria

### 2.1 Problem Understanding & Approach (0-5 pts)

- Comparison to state of the art: Does the team clearly define the problem and put it into context?
- Technical Feasibility: Is the approach reasonable given current or near turn quantum computational/AI hardware capacities? 
- Innovativeness: Does the solution bring a novel perspective or improvement compared to existing approaches? Has the participant demonstrated (potential) advantage over classical methods (e.g. speedup, accuracy, resource efficiency)? 
- Scalability: Can the approach be extended or scaled up? For larger PKPD datasets can this solution adapted for another use case such as drug resistance prediction?

### 2.2 Computational Resource Estimation (0-5 pts)
- Hardware Requirements: Did the team estimate the needed computational resources (GPUs, CPUs)? 

### 2.3 Technical Assessment (0-5 pts)
- Choice of Algorithms: Are the selected algorithms appropriate for the task?
- Justification of Methods: Is there a solid reasoning behind using specific architectures or techniques?
- Benchmark with existing solutions: Are existing solutions considered and benchmarked?

### 2.4 Structure of the Work Plan (0-5 pts)
- Step-by-Step Breakdown: Does the participant outline a clear roadmap how to approach the challenge?
- Risk Assessment & Mitigation: Are potential failure points identified with alternative solutions?

### 2.5 Team skills 0-5 (pts)
- Skillset: Does the team cover the necessary experience in quantum/AI techniques?

### 2.6 Proof of Concept / Prototype (non-mandatory; 0-5pts)
- Prototype Implementation: Has the team built a minimal working proof of concept? 
- Initial Results: Are preliminary results provided?
- Demonstration of Key Concepts: Does the proof of concept validate core ideas effectively?
