description:
  The Life Science Quantum Innovation Challenge for Pharmaceutical Development is a virtual competition combined with a pitch presentation event,
  organized by the Bio Innovation Institute (BII), Molecular Quantum Solutions (MQS) and QAI Ventures.
  Leading up to and at the beginning of the event, participants will
  brainstorm projects and form teams. Over the course of the event, teams will
  work together to deliver the project and showcase their project at the end of phase 1 (July-September).
  After phase 1, 5 teams with an academic affiliation will be selected and will retrieve access to Denmark's supercomputer Gefion (Phase 2).
  Phase 2 will run in October/November. The winner teams will be invited to showcase their project Q1 of 2025 at a selected conference.
  Come join us to explore, collaborate, innovate, and contribute to the advancement of quantum computing and quantum-inspired computing for pharmaceutical development!
