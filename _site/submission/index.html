    <h1 id="project-submission-requirements">Project submission requirements</h1>

<p>The projects must be submitted via a GitHub pull request where your code repository is licensed under the MIT (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or Apache Version 2.0 license (http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). If your submitted repository has no license affiliated with it, then your submission will be regarded as invalid and not taken into evaluation.</p>

<h1 id="language">Language</h1>
<p>Documentation regarding the challenge must be submitted in English.</p>

<h1 id="project-initialization">Project initialization</h1>

<p>As the three team leaders, to initialize your project<a href="/faq/" title="Can I participate in multiple projects?"><sup>(?)</sup></a>, please follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/Quantum-Innovation-Challenge/">this link to open up an issue in the respective challenge repository</a>. For example, if your team name is “Bayes Bandits”, the file should be named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project-bayes-bandits.md</code>.
The team name can be whatever you want it to be as long it aligns with our code of conduct.
Further, please also state the project name, your three team members names, GitHub usernames, and your company/institution affiliations.</li>
</ol>

<p>You do not already have to share a link to the repository you are working on for the challenge but feel free to also shae the link with your public challenge repo if you feel comfortable doing it. But we recommend to fork the Quantum-Challenge-2025 repo because you later have to submit your project with a pull request.</p>

<p>By experience we know that it can also be strategic to first share your repository to the public just before submission so that nobody can copy your ideas or build on top of them. But a challenge project like this over several months will probably not win just because you were hiding your development until just before the deadline. Check out the evaluation criteria to read up on how the scientific committee of this challenge will evaluate each project.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/" alt="project submission" /></p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Fork the Quantum-Challenge-2025 repo</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open op a github issue stating your team details and affilitions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit a pull request to Quantum-Challenge-2025 repo with the title “Submit project &lt;team-name: project-name&gt;” and tag your team members in the pull request description using the <code>@</code> symbol followed by their real names and affilitions. It is very important that the scientific evaluation committee can see the affilitions of the team members due to the needed academic affiliation of one team member. Make also sure that you have sent us via email the confirmation of the academic background of that team member in form of a … .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once the pull request is merged, your project will appear on <a href="/projects/">the projects page</a> of this portal and will also be moved into the projects folder together with all other projects in the Quantum-Challenge-2025 repo.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="project-showcase-and-evaluation">Project showcase and evaluation</h1>

<p>You can showcase your project in multiple ways and it is up to you how you would like to communicate your project in form of a video, a pdf report, a poster, or even an prototype software tool on-boarding documentation.</p>

<p>It is very important that your submitted pull request with the repo content holds all the needed information and links to be able to judge your project fully.</p>

<h2 id="end-of-quantum-challenge">End of Quantum Challenge</h2>

<p>To ensure a dynamic and engaging submission process, we ask that all challenge teams announce their final projects through social media (e.g., BlueSky, LinkedIn, YouTube etc.) and then link to their project folder within the Quantum-Challenge-2025 repo.</p>

<p>By sharing your work with a broader audience, you’ll help to promote groundbreaking research within pharmaceutical development while inspiring others to contribute to the field.</p>

<p>Here is a guideline for the optional presentation of your project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Optional but recommended: Create a concise video presentation (3 minutes or less) summarizing your team’s project, highlighting its application and novelty, and presenting your project outputs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upload your video to YouTube (unlisted is fine) and post about it on social media (e.g., BlueSky, LinkedIn, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With the pull request, update your project file with the YouTube video ID (e.g., IVaWl2tL06c<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> for https://youtu.be/IVaWl2tL06c</code>) and a sentence with a link to the social media post:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>github: Quantum-Challenge-2025/<span class="nt">&lt;project-name&gt;</span>
youtube_video: <span class="nt">&lt;your-video-id&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For the social media post, you would add a sentence like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Check out our social media post on [LinkedIn](&lt;your link here&gt;)!</code> before the References section.</p>

<p>This pull request will be considered your final submission for phase 1 of the challenge.</p>
